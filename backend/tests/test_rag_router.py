# Regarding GET /api/rag/knowledge-stats:
# No such endpoint was found in the provided router files (`routers/summaries.py`, `routers/tasks.py`, `main.py`).
# If this endpoint were to be added, tests would be structured similarly,
# likely mocking a service call that retrieves statistics from the RAG system (e.g., vector store).
# Example (if the endpoint existed):
#
# @patch('services.rag_service.get_knowledge_stats', new_callable=AsyncMock)
# def test_get_knowledge_stats(mock_get_stats, client):
#     mock_get_stats.return_value = {"vector_count": 1000, "indexed_documents": 50}
#     response = client.get("/api/rag/knowledge-stats")
#     assert response.status_code == 200
#     assert response.json() == {"vector_count": 1000, "indexed_documents": 50}
#     mock_get_stats.assert_called_once()

# For now, since the endpoint doesn't exist, the above is commented out.
# If a RAGService class with methods like `search_similar_weeks` exists and is directly
# used by a hypothetical `/api/rag/search` endpoint, the mocking strategy would target those methods.
# e.g., @patch('services.rag_service.RAGService.search_similar_weeks', new_callable=AsyncMock)
# However, current architecture points to `services.database.get_weekly_summaries` for search.

# If `RAGService.store_weekly_summary` was a distinct call in the summary creation flow,
# it would be mocked in `test_summary_router.py`. The current `summaries.py` router uses
# `services.database.create_weekly_summary` which is assumed to handle embeddings.
# The conftest.py `mock_chroma_client` and `mock_chroma_collection` fixtures
# suggest that ChromaDB is used, likely within the database service functions.
# These fixtures can be used if tests need to interact more directly with ChromaDB mocks,
# but for router tests, mocking the service interface (e.g., `services.database.get_weekly_summaries`)
# is generally preferred.

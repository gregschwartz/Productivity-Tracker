Here’s a functional brief for each module in your updated Productivity Tracker architecture, styled as a fusion of Ready.net and Tron: Legacy aesthetics.

## Task Management


### Daily Task List Screen (Ready.net x Tron Legacy)

#### Default State

- **Layout & Hierarchy**
  - Dark background (deep black or very dark blue/charcoal). Subtle, glowing grid lines (cyan or Ready.net purple) might be visible in the background.
  - Page header “TODAY’S TASKS” (xl bold, angular, futuristic font, glowing cyan or light purple), date subheading (base regular, dimmer glow).
  - Primary “+ ADD TASK” button (geometric shape, perhaps hexagonal or sharp-edged rectangle, glowing Tron-cyan outline and text, on a dark base) in top‑right.
  - Vertical list of task cards. Cards are dark, semi-transparent panes with glowing edges (cyan or accent purple).
    - Task name (md semibold, bright glowing text - e.g., white or light cyan).
    - Time‑spent badge (sm caps, dark background with glowing text/border in an accent color like orange or a secondary purple).
    - Focus‑level chip (represented by glowing bars or icons: e.g., three bright cyan bars for high, two orange for medium, one dim red/orange for low).
  - Space between cards allows background grid to show through.
- **Affordances & Signifiers**
  - Task card hover: edge glow intensifies, subtle hum or flicker animation.
  - Completed tasks: checkbox (glowing cyan) on left. When checked, card’s glow dims, content fades slightly, and a cyan strikethrough appears on the task name.
- **Animations & Feedback**
  - On load: cards materialize with a digital “rezzing” effect or quick glowing line animations (200ms).
  - Hover transitions: quick, sharp glow changes (100ms).
  - Checkbox toggle: emits a small particle burst or a quick flash of light.

#### Adding New Task

- **Holographic-Style Modal**
  - Clicking “+ ADD TASK” button triggers a modal that appears to project forward, with a dark, translucent background and glowing cyan/purple borders.
  - Fields:
    1.  **TASK DESCRIPTION** (text input with glowing caret and focus highlight, placeholder “LOG ACTIVITY…”).
    2.  **TIME ELAPSED** (digital-style inputs or selectors).
    3.  **FOCUS INTENSITY** (selector with glowing Tron-style icons/bars for low/medium/high).
  - Primary CTA “COMMIT” (glowing cyan button) and secondary “ABORT” (dimmer outline button).
- **Validation & Error Prevention**
  - Empty name: field border flashes red/orange, inline error text “DATA REQUIRED” (glowing red).
- **Saving State**
  - “COMMIT” button shows a data stream or energy pulse animation.
- **Post‑Save Success**
  - Modal de-rezzes; new task card digitally assembles in the list.
  - Brief system sound effect (optional, user-configurable).
- **Error State**
  - Modal border flashes red, error message “TRANSMISSION FAILED. RETRY.”

#### Editing & Deleting Task

- **Edit Trigger**
  - A glowing “EDIT” icon (e.g., a stylized circuit trace or wrench) appears on card hover.
  - Opens the same holographic modal, pre-filled.
- **Delete Trigger**
  - Glowing “DELETE” or “DEREZ” icon (e.g., a disintegrating square) on hover.
  - Confirmation: “DEREZ TASK? [CONFIRM] [CANCEL]” with glowing button outlines.
- **Delete State**
  - Card shatters, dissolves, or de-rezzes with a sound/visual effect.

## Storage Layer (Offline Resilience - Tron Style)

### Global Network Status Component

#### Online State

- A subtle, glowing hexagonal icon or a segment of the background grid in the header that pulses slowly with a cyan light, indicating “SYSTEM ONLINE. DATASTREAM ACTIVE.” on hover.

#### Offline State

- Icon turns orange or red, pulse becomes erratic or stops. Tooltip: “CONNECTION LOST. LOCAL CACHE ACTIVE.”
- A thin, glowing orange banner at the top:
  > “WARNING: OFFLINE MODE. DATA QUEUED FOR SYNC.”
- **Offline Task Operations**

## Visualization

### Productivity Dashboard Screen (Tron Grid Style)

#### Default State

  - Charts are rendered as glowing vector graphics on the dark grid background.
- **Chart Components**
  - **Heatmap (Chrono-Grid)**: A literal grid where cells glow with cyan/orange/purple intensity based on activity. Grid lines are prominent.
  - **Bar Chart (Energy Signatures)**: Bars are represented as glowing columns of light, possibly with energy particle effects. Axes are glowing lines.
- **Affordances**
  - Tooltips on hover: translucent dark panels with bright glowing text.
  - Interactive elements pulse or highlight with brighter glows.

#### Loading & Error States

This Ready.net x Tron Legacy design aims for a **futuristic, high-tech, and immersive aesthetic**. It combines Ready.net's structural organization with Tron's dark palette, glowing neon accents (primarily cyan, with secondary orange/purple), grid motifs, and angular, digital-inspired UI elements and animations.
